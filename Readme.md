# Djangy : Node.js binder for django templates

### what is this about?


Django templates are awesome, and probably one of the more mature template engines. Node is aweomse too but we missed the django template engine.

This solves the problem, a simple binding to render django templates including partials and return HTML back to node, ready to be sent to the client

### how to install?
     	1. install Python (obvious!)
     	2. install Django (pip install django / easy_install django)
     	3. npm install djangy (or install it globally if you like this a lot <3 )

#### how to use?
 		please see the test directory 
 
#### Broken Stuff
		1. no support for custom tags :/
		2. really bad error handling
		3. zero tests, really horrible
		4. no documentation
	
		this is probably not ready yet for production use

### Wanna Help?
			Fork away!!!
